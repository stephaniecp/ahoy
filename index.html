              <h2>Waiting for this Gale warning to pass</h2>
              <h5>June 14th 4:20pm PT</h5>
              <p>
                We are still planning on going to Lasqueti island next, but we have to wait for this gale warning to get past us first. What was predicted to be strong winds turned into a Gale warning today. We spent the night of the 12th (after leaving Nanaimo) in Nuttal bay, as we figured that our original plan of anchoring in Hammond bay wasn’t compatible with the winds shifting to the Southeast. Maybe you saw our silly <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/35254415426/in/dateposted-family/" target="_blank">video</a> from yesterday, but we did see a bunch of whales on Monday (12th) while under way. It was great and definitely the closest that I have seen them yet. The pictures and videos that came out are pretty bad, I was on the helm, trying to steer and record those guys. Did not do so well. Hopefully we see some more and better protographs come out of our next encounter. Anchoring wise, we found a great little pocket in Nuttal bay, protected from Southeasterly. Let’s just say that winds were not from the SE at the end, and we did not sleep much (lots of rocking around, all night). We started making our way to Lasqueti yesterday morning, conditions were rather shitty so we decided to turn around and find a safe spot for the next days (at least 2 days of strong winds starting then) and this is how we ended up in Schooner Cove marina. That’s right, first marina since May 1st. Oh well, sometime you got to do what you got to do and “schling schling” (sound of credit card being swiped). Gale warning coming, we don’t mess with that when there are so few protected anchorages around. John (from <a href="https://r2ak.com/2017-teams-full-race/team-adventure-ii/" target="_blank">team Adventure II</a> of the Race to Alaska) pulled in earlier in his sailing row boat. Wise man. Predicted winds look pretty bad for tomorrow (30-40 knots in the morning) and possibly all the way thru Saturday. Dang. We might be here for a bit...

              <p>
                Our stay in the Nanaimo/Newcastle island area is complete and we are ready to move on. We had our nanaimo bars, filled up on food, had showers, did laundry (to boat standards) and had the computer time we needed. We made it far enough North to change to a new set of charts as of right now, hurray! We are actually covering some distance! The forecast appears to be good for the next couple of days and we plan to make it to Hammond bay (only 6 nautical miles North from our current anchorage) tomorrow if weather holds up. Departure should be around 3pm, in order to have the currents in our favor. The Race to Alaska (<a href="https://r2ak.com/" target="_blank">R2AK</a>) departure was earlier today, at noon from Victoria, so maybe we get to see the faster boats passing us tomorrow! Hammond bay is quite protected to the Northwest but not so much to the East (and being this close to the Strait of Georgia, we don’t mess with that), so if winds hold up, that’s where we are going. As we get further North, resources diminish (gasoline/water/food/internet/power) but also hospitable bodies of water to safely anchor at night. The water gets extremely deep, too deep to anchor in many cases, but also tides and currents get pretty wild. Therefore, we are planning things carefully, finding lots of back up anchorages and giving ourselves very reasonable expectations for distances to go within days (perhaps we are even a little conservatives about it). We are thinking Hammond bay because it shaves a good amount of distance for Lasqueti island, our next defined stop. On the more fun side of things, there is a small island called Shack island (unofficial name, does not show up on any map that I have found) within Hammond bay, an island with an interesting history of squatters from the 30’s with houses, abandoned, still standing. Speaking of interesting small island history, the island we are standing on right now, Newcastle, has a long interesting history, but one part blew our mind especially, it’s the sandstone quarry that was running for about 60 years on the island. They would cut <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/35077263161/in/album-72157680575169792/" target="_blank">huge cylinders</a> out of the rock, in mass quantities, and sell them for pulping wood (breaking wood into fibers to make paper). The machinery used to cut those gigantic pieces of rock is still present on the island and the most impressive (I thought) were all the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34397919693/in/album-72157680575169792/" target="_blank">cuts-offs</a> of rocks with concave shapes, also just sitting around on the island. Fascinating stuff.

              <h2>In Nanaimo, home of the Nanaimo bar!</h2>
              <h5>June 9th 11:20am PT</h5>
              <p>
                Last Wednesday, June 7th, we left Vancouver and made it to Nanaimo (Vancouver island). Our time in the city was wonderful. Our funny side adventure week-end trip to PT was great and worth it. We did the road trip with our buddy Carl and saw an amazing group of acrobats perform their new show for the first time (incredible!). We hung out with our friends that night until 2-3am, slept in our workshop because we have a friend staying at our place while we are out and drove back up to Vancouver the next morning. In Vancouver, we got a few nights of almost no sleep paddling around False Creek nearly all night, including underneath the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=142565770%40N04&sort=date-taken-desc&text=paddle%20scienceworld%20vancouver&view_all=1" target="_blank">Science World</a> (structure on a pier) where Jon discovered a serious water leak of which he informed the people the next day. We watched cops on ATVs bust people for drinking beer on "Beer Island" (a beautiful small peninsula in a quiet spot, facing the big city) while sipping our beer peacefully drifting on the water in front of the crack-down. During our stay, we discovered <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BU0VJqzFxX3/?taken-by=thejongarrison" target="_blank">Picklebacks</a> when we accidently ordered some in a bar (shot of Whisky fallowed by a shot of pickle juice).  They were a great discovery. Last Wenesday, our anchoring permit was near its end, the anchor chain had a slight layer of green growth on it, we already had tons of sushi, and the winds were predicted to be too strong to sail the next day, so it was time to go. We picked up anchor Wednesday morning, and started crossing the Straight towards Nanaimo. The crossing was good, although we were quite tired (hung out with some awesome people until sometime past 3am). There was a great number of huge logs and trees floating randomly in the Strait, it was some exciting logs sight seeing actiivty. At this point we are anchored next to New Castle island (all park), facing the city of Nanaimo on the other side. We will likely go on a quest for the best Nanaimo bar sometime soon and let you know what the heck we decide to do next!

              <h2>Ready for one crazy week end trip, on the main land!</h2>
              <h5>June 2nd 1:14pm PT</h5>
              <p>
                We have been struggling about two events that both sound amazing, unfortunately happening on the same week end. One is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1899895423622386" target="_blank">serious acrobats/ninjas show</a> by our friends in Port Townsend, happening on Saturday (June 3rd in the evening), in PT. The other is the <a href="https://ios-openhouse.ca/" target="_blank">IOS Open house</a> (Institute of Ocean Sciences) on the Saanich peninsula. Such a hard choice. But because of the recent storm, we stayed in Montague harbour longer than expected, made it to Van later than we thought... and crossed the Strait of Georgia, on a schedule for the week end, seems logisticly difficult. Port townsend, on the other hand, is further away, but like every city, Vancouver has tons of car rentals and it turns out the drive isn't bad (3 hours with the Coopeville ferry)... So we will be driving down tomorrow morning! I won't be able to get my Current Atlas signed by the old guys behind it at the IOS, boo hoo, but we will get to see one show that we have every reasons to believe should be very amazing. We will pick up the car tomorrow morning, actually our plan is kind of funny, Jon and I will paddle back from the boat (with the folding bike onboard) to the public dock, Jon will then ride to the car rental and pick it up, put the bike in the trunk and drive back, I will head back with my kayak and tow Jon's kayak, then put one deflated kayak inside the boat, come back with the other kayak, deflate it, and put it in the trunk as well. Sounds silly but then we don't pay the over priced marina for Saturday night or worry about the kayak getting stolen. The boat is in good shape and we won't leave it very long as we will come back Sunday late afternoon/early evening.

                We arrived as expected on the 27th after a long crossing of the Strait of Georgia. The water was flat or near flat most of the way, we had some usable wind on which we sailed, but it was minimal so we had to keep the engine running to keep up our speed (we would arrive behind schedule otherwise, therefore counter current). Not good. It was incredibly sunny and warm, and at one point, we decided to stop the motor and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34979994085" target="_blank">jump in the water</a>, which turned out to be much warmer than expected. There was a funny stretch of extended <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34939529256" target="_blank">seaweed and debris</a>, so I turned off the engine (to prevent all that stuff from getting stuck on the propeller) and we got our two <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34939529086" target="_blank">canoe paddles</a> out, in the middle of a shipping lane. It was pretty funny, but we worked it out. The arrival in the city was interesting, after days of not many people at all, suddenly we were in a Walmart-like parking lot of huge freighters, a large number of Aquabusses running fast between traffic, dragon boaters and their coaches yelling, motor boats, sailboats, stand up paddle-boarders, kayakers, tourists on BBQ boats and so on...  We found a good spot to anchor in the middle of this mess, out of the channel, inside of False creek. Man, the boating scene is something out there. We were so wiped at our arrival, after several hours of attention on the helm and warm sun. I did the last before-bed check at 11pm, ready to go to bed... I then saw, all of our neighbors (except one) exactly in the position we would expect them to be, we were as well, but out most forward neighbor (should be forward at all time) ended up only a few feet alongside Strangewaves. Jon hopped in the kayak and knocked on the hull to see if someone was home (we would let them know that they have WAY too much rode out and that is being incredibly rude and disrespectful to everybody around and that they should pull some rode back). I tried to talk myself into staying there over night and watch the damn boat for a while, but it was wrong, too wrong to not move... So we motored out around midnight to a new spot. I stayed on watch for a while, and at around 1am we finally went to sleep, only to get woken up at 6am by another dude dropping his anchor way too close to us. Sigh. We talked to the guy, he seem to have his shit mostly together, but most importably, we got a phone number and permission to adjust his anchor line if it was posing a problem. About 2h later, another dude shows up awfully close from Stragewaves and dropped anchor. Damn city! Same deal, talked to the dude, and decided it was okay, he is closer than I would like, but at this point our <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34246186583/in/album-72157680575169792/" targer="_blank">3 boats</a> are so damn close that nobody else can even attempt coming closer, and since we have been this close for a couple of days, we know it works...  Ah, city drama. We are now at the Vancouver public library, downtown, trying to catch up with our last week of very little computer time. We got to meet with Jon's old friends from Portland, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34939521766" target="_blank">Jack & Jordanna</a> who happened to be on a short vacation up here, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/34816240092" target="_blank">Jonathan 2</a> (let's call him 2, because there are too many Jons on this page) a Toronto friend who now lives here, and finally yesterday with our old friend Carl, thru who Jon and I met here in 2013, who spends a lot of time here but is based out of the West Coast, all of it. We went for sushis together, because Carl always knows the best restaurants around. It was fantastic :-)

              <h2>On Gabriola island, heading to Vancouver</h2>
              <h5>May 27th 9:57am PT</h5>
              <p>Sorry for so few updates, we were stuck in beautiful places without power to charge my laptop. We made it to Montague harbor (Galiano island) ahead of the predicted storm that happened on the 23rd. We were there from Sunday the 21st and stayed thru Thursday (25th), because the winds were still annoyingly strong and perhaps unsafe to cross the Straight of Georgia, which we need to cross to go to Vancouver (our predicted next destination). The island was beautiful, phytoplankton/biolumisence (however you want to call them) were amazing and bright. I tried several settings to capture the light of the water glowing with my camera, but got black screen at every attemp. Oh well, I guess it has to be experienced in real life. Then we changed plans several times, so did the weather predictions... We ended up doing a stop on Mayne island and met the person behind these awesome <a href="http://borsboom.io/current-atlas-tables/" target="_blank">current tables</a> (ok, maybe we are water geeks) after writing him a fan letter. He and his wife had us over for dinner at their place and we all had a wonderful time. Friday morning (26th) we went from Mayne island to Gabriola. Had a great day on the water and covered some distance :) We anchored on the S side of Gabriola first, while waiting for the right currents to get thru Gabriola Passage (they get wild and way too strong otherwise) before we anchored for the night in Silva Bay (N side) in a mean low depth of 1 ft (high enough tide until the morning for our tiny draft Strangewaves) we are the only boat in our little paradise spot. Tide is going down, I am watching the rocks around the boat carefully, but we are fine. Will be starting to make our way toward Vancouver around 11am.

                We had an aweomse time on Salt Spring island so, the boat punks community is quite extraordinary out here. Our spot near the military barge has been a good anchorage. I scavenged a tiller extension (the actual thing sold in marine stores for too much money) from one of the old wrecks on the beach. Score! Also, we got to meet a bunch of the boat punks, young kids on free boats as well as old folks, just living the dream in shanty boat city. It reminds me a lot of Slab City in California, but floating. Seeing the number of boat wrecks under water discovering part of themselves at low tide and random ropes half floating in the water, we are hoping to paddle Strangewaves out of here (with our two crap unmatched paddles), sounds like fun :-) We got to stick around for the Saturday Market (a big deal) and play some disc golf on the awesome course. We went in with one pizza pan hoping to share it as our one frisbee (all that we could find frisbee wise) but one awesome group of people that we met on the trails let us use two of their actual frisbees instead, and even keep them! Hooray! More frisbee on this trip! Predicted winds out of the NE tomorrow at 10-15knots, seem like a good day to move over to Galiano!

                  We arrived in Ganges, Salt Spring island yesterday evening (Long harbor). We tried several anchoring spots before we were content with ours. There is a very large amount of boats anchored, on mooring balls and at anchor, tons of shanty boat (that means boats typicly in rough shape, used by live-abords, not moving in most cases for a very very long time), some anchored since forever with mussels growing on their anchor line (not even chain), some rafted together like entire small towns, wrecks of old shanty boats washed on the beaches around, a weird giant barge with military vehicle, floating homes attached to docks barely floating, of those homes, many that appear to be built of plywood likely stapled together with serious openings in between walls and windows, with solar panels crazy glued over their roof. No surprise we were welcomed by the Port master saying in the most welcoming way “fuck off, can’t use our dinghy dock”. Oh well. The beach is fine to land too, it turns out.

                    For anchoring, we opted for a very shallow spot near shore, between the giant barge with the military vehicle and two wrecks of old broken boats washed on the beach. Strangewaves has an additional stern anchor this time, to avoid drifting toward shore too much (too shallow). It is good to be back here, Ganges is a lovely town. We are likely staying here another day or two, then we will (probably) hit Montague harbor on Galliano island and from there cross to Vancouver anytime soon after! The library is awesome here and there are no extra-low tide in the next couple of days (would be a problem for the boat and we would need to move to a new spot), so no rush to leave yet.

                    As far as what we have been up to in the previous days, we stayed on Pender island over the weekend, met up with our friend Robin and his girlfriend as well as with her friends (locals from the island), who took us on a very beautiful hike on the North side of the island. It was absolutely beautiful, we stayed up there and had a picnic, foraged some wild food... For the record, this is what <a href="http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Zigadenus+venenosus" target="_blank">death camas</a> looks like ;-)  Pender island is filled with an unusual magic, always present in my experience. From the bioluminescence (creatures that glow in the water at night) very bright, brighter than anywhere that I have seen yet (they get very agitated and glow brighter and bigger as we paddle thru in the dark), to all the funny weird things happening there, like our <a href="http://infinitewalkabout.com/gear/adventure/nudity/yellow-jacket-disaster.html#.WRymKVPytE5" target="_blank">yellow jacket disaster</a> in 2013, or my brake cable snapping in a weird way that lead us to meet the entire town and be part of it for a couple of weeks after. If you have never been there and intend to check it out, bring a frizbee as they have the most amazing dics golf course and rent a kayak at night if you don’t have one with you. Ahh, Pender, it is such a wonderful island. We decided to leave on Sunday, as we had favorable winds and current to go to Saturna island and winds were predicted to get very strong the next day (20 to 25 knots, too much for sailing) and anchored in Boot Cove one night. That sucked. It is a beautiful place, well protected for the record, in a sweet little bay but surrounded by rich people’s houses (seconds more likely) and no public access to get anywhere we need, that is part of why we went for Winter Cove the next day. No power in any of those places, but Winter cove is a park and we went for a lovely hike looking at the Straight of Georgia, Vancouver etc.

              <h2>Back in Canada, Eh!</h2>
              <h5>May 12th 11:52am PT</h5>
              <p>
                Last night was beautiful. Satellite island turned out to be private so we did not check it out, but right across, easy kayak paddle away, was Stuart Island State Park, where we went for a sweet little hike. We got up early this morning to pick up the anchor by 7am, to catch the morning tide reversal. We made it to the customs dock, here in Bedwell Harbor (Canada!) at 8:30am or so this morning. Clearing customs with our Canadian boat (made in Quebec), registered in the U.S, with a U.S flag made in Canada, the Canadian and the American. Was easy like usual. We are now officially and legitimately in Canadian waters. We will be heading to Brackett Cove in a bit (2pm departure to get the favorable currents), very close by if you look on the map, but it is a tricky spot to get thru. The Pender Canal, separating North Pender and South Pender island, is connected by a bridge, with about 4.25 meters of clearance at high tide. We carefully measured the mast height earlier by running a measuring tape up the main halyard and estimating an extra couple of feet for the wind vane and antenna. It would be a terrifying idea, even with the clearance, it would be so close that I would probably pass out, and Jon would need to take over with a passed out Steph. But hey, after checking numbers carefully, we very certainly can’t get thru (hurray for me!), so we will go the long way! We are sitting in a sweet coffee shop now, my computer remembers the wifi from a long time ago hehe, we are looking at the boat and the water… waiting for the tide, once again :-)

              <p>
                Alright. The boat registration issue is set (much easier than expected) and although we like it here, it’s time to get back on the water! Well, technically, we kind of get in the water every day (kayaking to town and back to the boat), but I mean, in the water, further! Our next goal is to make it to Pender island (Canada) for Friday (meeting up with our friend Robin for the week end, hooray!). We are looking to sail to Satellite island in the next hour (waiting on the currents now) and spend the night there in order to get an easy crossing the next day to clear customs early on Pender island. Winds are quite light at the moment, it is raining, o well. Still a beautiful day ahead!

              <h5>May 8th 12:49pm PT</h5>
              <p>
                We arrived in Friday Harbor earlier this morning. Since our departure from Lopez, we spent a night in East Sound (Orcas island), where we got to check out Mt. Constitution, by which we were absolutely blown away (we had no expectations, did not know much about it and were quite surprised of such a gorgeous <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/142565770@N04/33769736883/in/dateposted-family/" target="_blank">view</a> up there). It is a decent hike to the top, from the boat to the bottom of the mountain first, plus the actual climb, the way back down and back to the boat. We ended up hitchiking to the top, hiked down, hitched a quick ride and walked the rest of the way to the boat, just in time for a quick stop at the grocery store and a paddle back to the boat as the sun sat. Last night, Sunday, winds were predicted to switch to S winds so we sailed to Shaw island (Blind bay) to anchor for the night, we met some interesting locals, got to play ping pong at the community center with some old folks, had a drink on the beach paddled back to the boat. I forgot the boat's registration sticker for the upcoming year likely in Port Townsend, so a visit to Friday Harbor is kind of obligated to fix that (only department of licensing in the area). We are now anchored in about 4ft of water, because Strangewaves can do this kind of thing!

              <h5>May 2nd 5:14pm PT</h5>
              <p>
                We arrived in Fisherman's bay (Lopez island) yesterday evening and anchored for the night. Winds were mellow and conditions ideal. One of the coolest libraries we know of is located only a few minutes walk from our current spot. So yes, that means internet and power easily accesible, therefore we have a cubicule for the next couple of days! Our next destination isn't decided yet, we do like this current spot and will likely stick around another day or two? We will let you know how things go!

              <p>
                So we left as expected earlier this morning, and started to make our way to Rosario beach. We made it almost halfway and decided to turn around. The winds turned out to be more than expected and not reducing at all (was originaly predicted to do so), standing waves were uncomfortably big and against us, our guess would be maybe 5 feet, so heading back the way we came (with the waves) definitely felt like less of a struggle (even though we had to fight current on the way back) but that was a good decision overall. The boat is fine and did great, we are fine, although a little sea sick. We made it back to Port Townsend around 2pm and will now carefully check the marine forecast for the next days and leave on next window of good sailing, possibly tomorrow (destination still to come).

                It is 11:37pm PT, Jon and I are both on the boat, at our usual slip in Port Townsend. After a few days of work, cleaning, running around, prepping, doing laundry, going back to get things forgotten, organizing the boat, and reorganizing it... we are finally laying down and ready to go. We are taking off tomorrow morning, around 8:30am to catch the favorable current and make it to Rosario Beach (Fidalgo island) plenty of time ahead for our two dear friends' wedding ceremony. We will likely anchor in Bowman Bay for the night. Strangewaves (the boat) is more loaded than she ever has been in the time I have owned her (just over 2 years), but everything fit nicely, or mostly and the water line is still happy. This is the beginning of the adventure!

      <h3>The Plan</h3>
      
      <p>
        The vision for this trip has changed quite a bit over the last couple of months but at this point we are planning on sailing around the Salish sea for a while, spending some time on various islands of the San Juan Islands (U.S), the Gulf Islands (Canada), Vancouver BC and hopefully Lasqueti Island (BC). The route is still very open, actually we haven't figured out much of it yet. We are hoping to sleep mostly at anchor, with some exceptions for cold nights, storms, need to recharge the batteries (which we will find out how long they last) or too many days of rain in a row (requiring an electric heater to dry off our clothes). As Jon will still be working on his current software project, we will be exploring libraries a lot and hunting for cafes, wifi and power. As of for me, having started learning html/css and basic programming recently, I created this blog using stuff recently learned and playing with making this site is a good way for me to pratice all this fun stuff and keep the awesome people in our lives updated about our adventure. Equipped with a 5 gallon water tank, no heater and about 33L (8.75 Gallons) of fuel, we are ready for the challenge!  If winds go as planned, we are leaving Sunday April 30th early in the morning and coming back sometime in July. This is going to be by far our longest trip onboard Strangewaves!

        That's me. I am the captain and blogger and the one mostly keeping this blog up to date. I will try my best to put updates about where we are and what we are up to every week (depending on internet connection, power and motivation). My experience with sailing is still relatively recent, but to draw the big picture I had the chance to crew a few times between 2014 and 2015 for small day-sails on friend's boats. That same winter, after a long bicycle trip from PT to San Diego, Jon and I got to live on a motor boat and had the opportunity to learn more about sailing during that same period, and the idea grew from there... I moved to Victoria in the beginning of 2015, started reading more about sailing... and looked for a boat to buy. This is how I found Strangewaves <3

        Jon, as I am sure you already know (not many people will read this blog is my guess) grew up sailing with his dad on the East Coast and has had an interest in sailing for a long time. He had the chance to crew with a good friend of ours from Port Townsend to Petersberg, AK, a couple of years ago (check out his <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/earthwandering/albums/72157644544117620" target="_blank">pictures</a>). With his great skill at convincing his friends to get boats (so he gets to crew and not maintain the thing) he was definitely a significant part of the beginning of my quest to find a sailboat. This said, I am glad he did and sailing with such a goofball is quite a wonderful thing. Silly when conditions allow it, serious/cautious when needed, and so far never seasick (in my experience with him at least), it's a lot of fun to cruise with him.

      <h3>The Boat</h3>
      
      <img class="withborder" src="images/tanzer7.5.gif" alt="Tanzer 7.5 model picture" Title="Tanzer 7.5"  align="right" height="200" width="200">
      <p>
        The Boat is a Tanzer 7.5 (stands for 7.5 meters, so just under 25 feet), built in 1978. She is a sloop and was designed by Johann Tanzer. The 7.5 model was designed with two different keels, the fin keel and shoal keel (the one Strangewaves has), with only 2.67ft draft. She is equipped with a 9.9 horsepower 2012 Yahama outboard engine (kick ass little thing), 5 (19L) Gallons water tank (that's right, but we do have extra gallons stashed everywhere), about 33L (8.75Gallons) of fuel capacity, and no source of heating at anchor. We are not sissies (we hope)!
      </p>
      <p>
        She was purchased by myself in Victoria, BC in March 2015 as I was looking for both a cheap place to live in Victoria and a way to do more sailing.
